HBMR ("HBase Map/Reduce") is a simplistic library for doing mapreduce on HBase tables.

Key principles:
- input and output are hbase tables;
- all data being processed are represented as strings;
- two kinds of mapreductions:
- a) map and then reduce; make sure you have a monoid that you reduce;
- b) just map, no reduction: meaning you most probably do not even produce anything during map phase - or maybe you do.

The purpose of this library is this:

- a bunch of people just don't understand what map/reduce is, and either are lost, 
or invent their own math; that's sad;
- the existing API is approximately 42 times more complex than it should or could be.

I owe you a good wiki page that explains everything in pretty easy terms and short sentences.
